# VideoBase

## Summary
Small self-study project to get accustomed to Sequelize ORM.

## Database structure
* The database will contain a list of meta-data about video-files (served statically by the node.js server or nginx server in prod) in a table, and some information regarding adds-on in another table (to be able to practice the one-to-many relationships).

## Technology used

- `Express` for the back-end server and Rest API
- `Sequelize` for the database ORM
